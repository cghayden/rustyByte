# Scan File Uploads. 

A. AWS Lambda + ClamAV (DIY, cheapest)

Trigger a Lambda function when files upload to S3
Lambda runs ClamAV (open-source antivirus) to scan the file
Move clean files to a "verified" bucket, quarantine bad ones
Cost: Just Lambda execution time (~$0.20 per 1M requests)

or

B. Amazon GuardDuty Malware Protection for S3

AWS's built-in option (released 2024)
Automatically scans objects uploaded to S3
Integrates with Security Hub for alerts
Cost: ~$0.60 per GB scanned + per-object fee

or Third-Party Services :

C. Trend Micro Cloud One - File Storage Security

Drop-in S3 scanning, very easy to set up
Deploys via CloudFormation template
~$0.10 per 1,000 files scanned





Create Themes:
what if we wanted to keep the current design system but make an alternative design system?  

Can you put together a markdown document called THEMES.md that would outline what we would need to do. 

Brainstorm Ideas  and steps that I want to incorporate into that THEMES.md file: 

I would remove the 'tavern' from the color class names, and make a more formalized naming convention that is more in line with tailwinds numbering system.  So our themes would have names like 'tavern', 'ocean', 'space', and the colors would have names like tavern-100, tavern-200, etc. 

examples of some Other theme related class names we would need: (replace 'theme' with the name of the theme):
 theme-button-action, 
 theme-button-active, 
 theme-button-disabled,
 theme-button-danger,
 theme-complementary-?,
theme-complementary-?,
theme-white,
theme-text-light,
theme-text-dark


#Implementation: 
theme choice could go in dashboard for the user,

theme choice could be saved in local storage or on the users database entry to be consistent across browsers

classNames would have to be dynamic: e.g. [theme]-bg-dark. and the theme would have to re-render in browser?
